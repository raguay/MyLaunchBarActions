All normal **[Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)** helper functions are usable as well. This is not a complete guide to using **Handlebars**.\n\nAll **Handlebars** macros can be rapped in `{{ }}` for HTML escaping of characters, or `{{{ }}}` for raw outputing.\n\nThe **save** helper takes two parameters in quotation marks: the _name_ and the _value_. A new helper is then created with the _name_ that will produce the _value_. The helper also returns the value to be placed in it's place. From that point on, all macros that use the _name_ will be replaced with the _value_."

      "data": "The **clipboard** helper will be replaced with the current contents of the clipboard."

      "data": "The **date** helper will be replaced with the current date formated by the **[Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/string-format/)** formatting variables given as the argument.\n\nThe **cdate** helper will be replaced with the date/time specifed by the first argument and the **Moment.js** formatting as the second argument. The date/time format has to follow **2013-02-08 24:00:00.000** format."

    {
      "type": "markdown",
      "data": "The **next** helper will be replaced with the date/time relative to the current date/time. It takes three arguments: **weeks**, **dow**, **fmat**. The weeks is the relative number of weeks. Therefore, this week is 0, next week is 1, in two weeks is 2, last week is -1. The **dow** is the day of the week of that week. Therefore, **weeks** set to 1 and **dow** set to \"Sat\" will give the Saturday of next week. The **fmt** is the formatting for the date/time as specified in the **[Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/docs/)** documentation. \n\nAn example is:\n\n{{next -1 \"Mon\" \"YYYY-MM-DD\"}} will give the monday of last week in Year-Month Number-two digit day. Example straight from the clipboard is: 2016-03-28 and the day I wrote this is 04/08/2016."
