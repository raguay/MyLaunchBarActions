This \"snippet\" will never show up in the list of snippets for expansion. Therefore, you can define globally used data that is inserted into your snippets. \n\nSince you can cut/paste individual cells really easily, you can create a notebook of different data sets, and cut and paste fragments from that notebook to the **Defaults** note. All **code** cells set to **json** will be pulled into the expansion. Any other cell types will be ignored.\n\nAlso, you can split up the **JSON** structure among many cells. They will be imported and added to the main structure. Any data redefined by a cell lower than the original one will be over-written.\n\nAny **code** cells with a **json** data structure in a snippet note will also be added to the main data structure and will override whatever is loaded from the **Defaults** data structure."
